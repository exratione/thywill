Calculations Application
------------------------

This is a trivial application in which a user enters numbers and obtains the
results of calculations on those numbers. It demonstrates remote procedure
calls from client to server made via Thywill messaging.

Start the application manually as follows:

    node /applications/calculations/service/start.js

Read /docs/applicationServiceSetup.md for instructions on how to set up the
application to run as a service.
