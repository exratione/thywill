Echo Application
================

This is a trivial message application that echoes back text entered by the
user. It demonstrates the bare minimum setup for a Thywill application.

Start the application manually as follows:

    node /applications/echo/service/startEcho.js

Read /docs/applicationServiceSetup.md for instructions on how to set up the
application to run as a service.
