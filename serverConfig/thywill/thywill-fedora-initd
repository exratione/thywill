# An example init.d script for running a Thywill application as a service
# using Forever as the process monitor. For more configuration options
# associated with Forever, see: https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever
#
# This is suitable for RPM-based distributions such as Fedora. It will not
# work on Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions.
#
# You will need to alter the following items:
#
# 1) Set the environment variables noted below to conform to your use case.
#
# 2) Change the chkconfig section below.
#
# chkconfig: 345 80 20
