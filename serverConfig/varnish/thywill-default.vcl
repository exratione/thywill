#
# An example Varnish configuration.
#
# This is not suitable for production use - it is a quick-start example
# intended to help set up Thywill for development and show how Varnish
# can be set up for use with Thywill.
#
# Important note: this configuration disables all Varnish caching! It
# only illustrates how to use Varnish to divide websocket and non-websocket
# traffic arriving at a single port, and sent to off to different backends.
#
# For more comprehensive Varnish configurations that handle additional
# functionality unrelated to Node.js and websockets, but which is
# nonetheless absolutely vital for any serious use of Varnish in a 
# production environment, you might look at:
