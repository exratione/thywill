Thywill
=======

Thywill is a component framework for building single page web applications that
use secure asynchronous messaging to communicate between client and server.

Overview
--------

Thywill is a Node.js framework for building a particular type of single-page
web application:

  * Based on asynchronous messaging
  * All traffic is sent encrypted over SSL
  * Uses Socket.IO as a communication layer
  * Functionality can be exposed to clients progressively

In Thywill, messages are passed asynchronously between connected web clients
and the server, and can be initiated at any time by either the client or the
server. This will no doubt be familiar to anyone who has worked with
WebSockets or the other similar approaches to allow a web server to push data
to a client.

Noteworthy Features
-------------------

  * Attach to any http.Server instance - so use Thywill in conjunction with Express, for example
  * Optionally share sessions with Express
  * Minification of Javascript and CSS resources
  * EJS and Handlebars template engines are supported, others can be added
  * The client can issue remote procedure calls to server functions
  * Component architecture for easy extension or replacement of core functionality
  * Example server configurations for running Thywill applications as a service
  * Example applications to demonstrate setup and usage

Example Applications
--------------------

You can manually run the simplest example Thywill application, Echo, as
follows:

    cd path/to/thywill
    node applications/echo/service/startEcho

Navigate to the following URL on your server to see it in action.

    http://example.com:10080/echo/

Then read /doc/applicationServiceSetup.md for instructions on how to set up a
Thywill application Node.js process as a service.

Go on to read /doc/serverSetup.md for instructions on how to set up a server
with an SSL-capable proxy so as to run a Thywill application securely via HTTPS
connections. With that built, you can access Echo as follows:

    https://example.com/echo/

Building New Thywill Applications
---------------------------------

A Thywill application implements the necessary server and client interfaces to:

  * Send and receive messages through Thywill
  * Add Javascript, CSS, and other resources to be loaded by a client

The example applications found under /applications demonstrate how this is
accomplished by extending the Application class on the server and the
ApplicationInterface class on the client.

Beyond this minimum, a Thywill application can contain any arbitrary code. It
does its thing, while Thywill manages the message transport between server and
client.

Remote Procedure Calls
----------------------

An application can issue remote procedure calls to server functions if it
extends RpcCapableApplication on the server and RpcCapableApplicationInterface
on the client.

In the server code:

    function ExampleApplication (id) {
      ExampleApplication.super_.call(this, id);
      // Set up an example function in a namespace.
      this.rpcContext.exampleFunctions = {
        exampleFunction: function (count) {
          return count * 2;
        }
      };
    }
    util.inherits(ExampleApplication, Thywill.getBaseClass("RpcCapableApplication"));

In the client code:

    function ExampleApplicationInterface (applicationId) {
      Thywill.RpcCapableApplicationInterface.call(this, applicationId);
    }
    Thywill.inherits(ExampleApplicationInterface, Thywill.RpcCapableApplicationInterface);

Then to make a remote procedure call from the client:

    var data = {
      // Will look for this.rpcContext.exampleFunctions.exampleFunction in the
      // server Application instance context.
      name: "exampleFunctions.exampleFunction",
      // True if the server function is asynchronous and accepts a callback as
      // the last argument.
      hasCallback: false,
      // Arguments for the remote function, omitting the final callback
      // argument if it has one.
      args: [10]
    };
    exampleApplicationInterface.rpc(data, function (error, result) {
      // result === 20
      console.log(result);
    });

See the Calculations example application for a simple demonstration.

A Work in Progress
------------------

Thywill is very much a work in progress, proceeding at a sedate pace. It
remains skeletal at this time, with much to be done. Nonetheless, the core
functions - it is possible to write applications on top of Thywill, should
you so feel the urge.

You will want to read through the material in /doc, and if interested take
a look at the example applications in /applications.
