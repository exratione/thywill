Thywill
-------

Thywill is a Node.js framework for building a particular type of single-page
web application:

  * Based on asynchronous messaging
  * All traffic is sent over SSL

In Thywill, messages can be passed at any time between connected web clients 
and the server, whether they originate with the client or the server. This is
by default achieved using websockets.

Thywill Applications
--------------------

A Thywill application is any Node.js code that implements the necessary
interface to:

  * Send and receive messages through Thywill
  * Add Javascript, CSS, and other resources for loading when a client connects

The example applications demonstrate how this is accomplished.
