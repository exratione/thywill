Thywill Server Setup for Ubuntu
-------------------------------

This document outlines the setup and configuration of a Thywill server on
Ubuntu, which uses Stunnel and Varnish as frontend servers, while Nginx and
Node.js act as backend servers to provide static and dynamic content:

  * All content is served over SSL
  * Stunnel decrypts HTTPS traffic and passes HTTP traffic to Varnish
  * Varnish manages distribution of traffic between Node.js and Nginx backends
  * Nginx serves static files for Thywill
  * Nginx can also be used to serve an unrelated website
  * Each Thywill application runs as a separate Node.js backend process
  * Node.js processes are managed as services

The starting point for the purposes of this guide is a bare bones Ubuntu 12.04
server - it probably won't even have your favorite text editor installed at the
outset.

Install Node.js
---------------

First install the packages required by Node.js:

    apt-get install python openssl openssl-devel gcc-c++ make

Next create a user to run Node.js and switch to that user:

    useradd m -d /home/node node
    su - node

Then install and build the latest version of node.js in the node user home
directory. You'll want to have the node.js source downloaded and unpacked
(or checked out from Github) into /home/node/node and owned by the node user.
Then:

    cd /home/node/node
    export JOBS=2
    mkdir ~/local
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/node
    make
    make install
    
Lastly, you will need to add the node executables to the PATH environment
variable and set the NODE_PATH such that Node.js can see modules in the main
node_modules library folder. You should probably set this up for all users, 
which can be done as follows.

Create the file /etc/profile.d/node.sh containing the following lines:

    export PATH=/home/node/local/node/bin:$PATH
    export NODE_PATH=/home/node/local/node/lib/node_modules

Depending on your setup, you may instead need to create the file 
/etc/profile.d/node.csh containing the following lines:

    setenv PATH /home/node/local/node/bin:$PATH
    setenv NODE_PATH /home/node/local/node/lib/node_modules

Node User Permissions
---------------------

Depending on what you want to do with Node.js (e.g. bind to privileged
ports < 1024), you may want to allow the node user to be able to use sudo. In
Ubuntu, add a file "node" into /etc/sudoers.d which should contain the
following line:

    node        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

For a production server, you would probably want to constrain the node user's
options a little more than the blanket sudo access above.

Install Thywill
---------------

Installing through NPM will automatically install the necessary dependencies.

    npm install thywill
    
If setting up for development on Thywill, then you instead might clone the
repository and then use NPM to link it locally, allowing you to update the
code but still otherwise treat it as an installed package.

    cd /home/node
    git clone git://github.com/exratione/thywill.git
    cd thywill
    npm link
    
Set Up a Thywill Application to Run as a Service
------------------------------------------------

To set up an application as a service, follow the instructions in
/doc/applicationServiceSetup.md. An applications's service directory will
typically contain the following items:

  * Start Node.js script
  * Shutdown preparation Node.js script
  * Service scripts that will have to be copied /etc/init.d or /etc/init
  * Default configuration Javascript file
  
The service script files contain paths to various files in the Thywill
directories. These will only be correct if Node.js is installed as described in
this document - otherwise they must be edited in order for the scripts to work.

Proxy Server Arrangement
------------------------

The following arrangement of server processes is used:

  * Stunnel on port 443
  * Varnish on port 80
  * Nginx on port 8080
  * Thywill Node.js applications on ports 10080+
  
Prior to version 1.3, Nginx cannot pass websocket traffic as a proxy, so
Varnish is the frontend proxy. It passes websocket traffic and other relevant
URLs directly to the appropriate Node.js backends, and remaining traffic to
Nginx.

Varnish doesn't handle SSL traffic, so Stunnel is used to terminate HTTPS
requests and pass them on as HTTP requests to Varnish. It is possible to
distinguish between HTTP connections proxied by Stunnel and HTTP connections
arriving directly from a client: Varnish redirects all such direct HTTP
connections to HTTPS.

Set Up Stunnel
--------------

Varnish cannot manage SSL traffic, so Stunnel is used to field HTTPS traffic.
Install Stunnel as a package:

    apt-get install stunnel
    
Next set up the Stunnel configuration file as required. An example configuration
is provided in:

    /serverConfig/stunnel/thywill-stunnel4.conf
    
Copy this into the /etc/stunnel/ directory (each separate *.conf file there
will be used to launch a separate Stunnel process when the Stunnel service
starts). Note that this is probably not going to be suitable for production
use, or for anything other than running the Thywill example applications.
 
You must obtain and upload your SSL certificate and key as a single
concatenated file - key then certificate - and change the default Pound
configuration to point to that file.

If you are working on a development server, then setting up a self-signed
certificate is sufficient. That can be accomplished as follows:

    apt-get install ssl-cert
    make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite
    cat /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem > /etc/ssl/snakeoil.pem
    
This will create these files:

    /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
    /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
    /etc/ssl/snakeoil.pem

That third is just the first two concatenated together, and it's what the
default Stunnel configuration is looking for.

Lastly you will have to edit /etc/default/stunnel4 to set the following line, 
otherwise the process will not start.

    # Change to one to enable stunnel automatic startup
    ENABLED=1

Set Up Varnish
--------------

Install Varnish as a package:

    apt-get install varnish
   
Next, set up the configuration as required for your server scenario. A default
configuration suitable for any of the example applications is provided in:

    /serverConfig/varnish/thywill-default.vcl
    
Copy the contents into your Varnish configuration file /etc/varnish/default.vcl.
Note that this configuration is far from suitable for production use - it is an
example only, and omits most of the useful things that Varnish can do.

Now alter these lines in /etc/default/varnish to tell Varnish to run on port 80
rather than the default 6081:

    DAEMON_OPTS="-a :80 \
      -T localhost:6082 \
      -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl \
      -S /etc/varnish/secret \
      -s malloc,256m"

Set Up Nginx
------------

Nginx will be set up here to serve both normal website content and Thywill
static files in their subfolders. Varnish will split traffic between the two
uses. First, install Nginx:

    apt-get install nginx

Since Nginx will be used to serve static files set out by Thywill applications,
permissions will have to be arranged so that both Node.js processes and Nginx
have access to the portion of the webroot used for these files. There are many
different ways of arranging this, and this is only one of them:

  * Nginx runs as the www-data user and has its webroot in /var/www
  * Thywill applications will write static files to /home/node/thywill-static
  * A symlink runs from /var/www/thywill-static to /home/node/thywill-static
  * The www-data user is given read permission on /home/node/thywill-static

Create the static folder and symlink as root and give them the appropriate
ownership and permissions:

    mkdir /var/www
    chown www-data:www-data /var/www
    mkdir /home/node/thywill-static
    ln -s /home/node/thywill-static /var/www/thywill-static
    chown node:www-data /home/node/thywill-static
    chmod 755 /home/node/thywill-static

There is a very simplistic default site configuration for Nginx on port 8080
in the following location:

    /serverConfig/nginx/thywill-default.conf
    
Make a backup of /etc/nginx/sites-available/default and the copy the above
configuration file over the original /etc/nginx/sites-available/default. This
should already be symlinked in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and thus active.

Restart Everything
------------------

You'll most likely have to restart Varnish, Nginx, and Stunnel after you are
done with all the configuration.

    service stunnel restart
    service varnish restart
    service nginx restart
    
And also restart the example Thywill applications you have set up as services.
